The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is, 
<br><centre>1<sup>2</sup>+2<sup>2</sup>+......+10<sup>2</sup>=385</centre>

The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
<br><centre>(1+2+....+10)<sup>2</sup>=55<sup>2</sup>=3025</centre>

Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025-385=2640.

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
